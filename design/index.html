        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <h5><a href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart</a></h5>

        <img src="">

        <p>Walmart's website utilizes white space well on their home page as shown above. Walmart sells many products so it is important for them to use a clean design so as to not overwhelm their customers. The white speace enables users to see what the site creators want them to see as seperate elements.</p>

    <div class="h3">
        <h3>Visual Heirarchy</h3>
        <h5><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h5>

        <img src="">

        <p>On Apple's website, it is clear what the most important element on the webpage is. Due to the utilization of Visual Heirarchy, users can clearly see that Apple wants to heavily promote the iPhone 11 Pro. Since it is the largest centered item, one can easily tell that it is the most important. There are other smaller secondary items that are also clearly meant to be complementary rather than the main focus.</p>

    <div class="h4">
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <h5><a href="http://library.byui.edu/">David O. McKay Library</a></h5>

        <img src="">

        <p>The David O. McKay library is a website that contains a lot of imformation and focuses on displaying that informaiton rather than promoting a product. Alignment is important to use with this kind of website so as to not overwhelm users with text, busyness, or too much content on one page. Users can see from the alignment of the logos on the page that they are seperate and can better tell where to go for certain information. </p>
